As always have fun generating.\n\nTrigger word: sc3n1ch0r1s0ns\n\nStrength: I just leave it at 1 but feel free to experiment\n\nI recommend describing you image in great detail if you don't want to type a lot just use chatGPT to describe an image for you.\n\n\n......................\n\n(+)\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nin the background a massive glowing eye looms large

the foreground facing away from the viewer dressed in a dark blue jacket with the word \"fbi\" emblazoned on the back in bold yellow letters, the figure's face is obscured making it difficult to discern any distinct features, the jacket's sleeves are rolled up and the hands are clasped behind the back giving an air of confidence and authority,in the background a massive glowing eye looms large dominating the scene, the eye is depicted in shades of blue and green with intricate swirling patterns that evoke a sense of otherworldly presence, the surrounding environment is a dark starry night sky with a subtle gradient of deep blues and purples,to the left and right of the figure the landscape is a mix of dry withered grass and sparse twisted branches adding to the eerie atmosphere, the overall mood is one of mystery and foreboding as if the figure is about to uncover a hidden truth or confront an unknown entity\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nto the left of the house a small figure dressed in a bright red coat stands on the snow-covered ground looking up at the burning house, the figure's face is not visible adding to the sense of mystery, the snow around the house is pristine and untouched except for a faint footprint trail leading from the figure to the house,the sky above is a deep gradient blue with a few wispy clouds scattered across it, the overall atmosphere is one of stark contrast between the cold serene winter landscape and the intense fiery scene unfolding at the center, the style is reminiscent of contemporary digital art\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthe image is a vibrant semi-realistic digital painting depicting a dramatic scene. in the foreground a lone figure is perched on a high-voltage transmission tower dressed in a dark outfit with a helmet and safety gear suggesting a utility worker or climber. the figure is positioned on the right side of the image near the top of the tower with one hand grasping the structure and the other holding a tool or equipment.\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthis is a whimsical semi-realistic digital illustration featuring a serene and dreamy scene, the image depicts a man and a small dog standing in a lush open field at sunset, the man dressed in a dark suit and hat is standing on the driver's side of an old worn-out pickup truck which is parked on the left side of the image, he is holding a phone to his ear suggesting he is engaged in a conversation, the dog a small breed with a brown coat stands beside the truck looking up at the man with a curious expression,the sky above is ablaze with hues of orange pink and purple indicating a breathtaking sunset, soft fluffy clouds are scattered across the sky adding to the serene atmosphere, the truck with its vintage design and worn paint blends harmoniously with the natural surroundings, the illustration style is characterized by soft brushstrokes and subtle color gradations giving the scene a warm nostalgic feel, the overall mood is peaceful and contemplative inviting the viewer to pause and appreciate the tranquil moment\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1>

This model is intended for epic landscapes but is also good for general use. As always have fun generating.\n\nTrigger word: sc3n1ch0r1s0ns\n\nStrength: I just leave it at 1 but feel free to experiment\n\nI recommend describing you image in great detail if you don't want to type a lot just use chatGPT to describe an image for you.\n\n\n......................\n\n(+)\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nin the background a massive glowing eye looms large

the foreground facing away from the viewer dressed in a dark blue jacket with the word \"fbi\" emblazoned on the back in bold yellow letters, the figure's face is obscured making it difficult to discern any distinct features, the jacket's sleeves are rolled up and the hands are clasped behind the back giving an air of confidence and authority,in the background a massive glowing eye looms large dominating the scene, the eye is depicted in shades of blue and green with intricate swirling patterns that evoke a sense of otherworldly presence, the surrounding environment is a dark starry night sky with a subtle gradient of deep blues and purples,to the left and right of the figure the landscape is a mix of dry withered grass and sparse twisted branches adding to the eerie atmosphere, the overall mood is one of mystery and foreboding as if the figure is about to uncover a hidden truth or confront an unknown entity\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nto the left of the house a small figure dressed in a bright red coat stands on the snow-covered ground looking up at the burning house, the figure's face is not visible adding to the sense of mystery, the snow around the house is pristine and untouched except for a faint footprint trail leading from the figure to the house,the sky above is a deep gradient blue with a few wispy clouds scattered across it, the overall atmosphere is one of stark contrast between the cold serene winter landscape and the intense fiery scene unfolding at the center, the style is reminiscent of contemporary digital art\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthe image is a vibrant semi-realistic digital painting depicting a dramatic scene. in the foreground a lone figure is perched on a high-voltage

one hand grasping the structure and the other holding a tool or equipment.\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthis is a whimsical semi-realistic digital illustration featuring a serene and dreamy scene, the image depicts a man and a small dog standing in a lush open field at sunset, the man dressed in a dark suit and hat is standing on the driver's side of an old worn-out pickup truck which is parked on the left side of the image, he is holding a phone to his ear suggesting he is engaged in a conversation, the dog a small breed with a brown coat stands beside the truck looking up at the man with a curious expression,the sky above is ablaze with hues of orange pink and purple indicating a breathtaking sunset, soft fluffy clouds are scattered across the sky adding to the serene atmosphere, the truck with its vintage design and worn paint blends harmoniously with the natural surroundings, the illustration style is characterized by soft brushstrokes and subtle color
