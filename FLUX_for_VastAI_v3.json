        "This is basically a port of my Scenic Horizons model for PonyXL but with a few key differences, I expanded the dataset and I used a new captioning model that's quite good and I think It really shows. This model is intended for epic landscapes but is also good for general use. As always have fun generating.\n\nTrigger word: sc3n1ch0r1s0ns\n\nStrength: I just leave it at 1 but feel free to experiment\n\nI recommend describing you image in great detail if you don't want to type a lot just use chatGPT to describe an image for you.\n\n\n......................\n\n(+)\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nin the background a massive glowing eye looms large dominating the scene. the eye is depicted in shades of blue and green with intricate swirling patterns that evoke a sense of otherworldly presence. the surrounding environment is a dark starry night sky with a subtle gradient of deep blues and purples.,\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthe image is a digital illustration with a surreal dreamlike quality, a lone figure stands in the foreground facing away from the viewer dressed in a dark blue jacket with the word \"fbi\" emblazoned on the back in bold yellow letters, the figure's face is obscured making it difficult to discern any distinct features, the jacket's sleeves are rolled up and the hands are clasped behind the back giving an air of confidence and authority,in the background a massive glowing eye looms large dominating the scene, the eye is depicted in shades of blue and green with intricate swirling patterns that evoke a sense of otherworldly presence, the surrounding environment is a dark starry night sky with a subtle gradient of deep blues and purples,to the left and right of the figure the landscape is a mix of dry withered grass and sparse twisted branches adding to the eerie atmosphere, the overall mood is one of mystery and foreboding as if the figure is about to uncover a hidden truth or confront an unknown entity\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nto the left of the house a small figure dressed in a bright red coat stands on the snow-covered ground looking up at the burning house, the figure's face is not visible adding to the sense of mystery, the snow around the house is pristine and untouched except for a faint footprint trail leading from the figure to the house,the sky above is a deep gradient blue with a few wispy clouds scattered across it, the overall atmosphere is one of stark contrast between the cold serene winter landscape and the intense fiery scene unfolding at the center, the style is reminiscent of contemporary digital art\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthe image is a vibrant semi-realistic digital painting depicting a dramatic scene. in the foreground a lone figure is perched on a high-voltage transmission tower dressed in a dark outfit with a helmet and safety gear suggesting a utility worker or climber. the figure is positioned on the right side of the image near the top of the tower with one hand grasping the structure and the other holding a tool or equipment.\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthis is a whimsical semi-realistic digital illustration featuring a serene and dreamy scene, the image depicts a man and a small dog standing in a lush open field at sunset, the man dressed in a dark suit and hat is standing on the driver's side of an old worn-out pickup truck which is parked on the left side of the image, he is holding a phone to his ear suggesting he is engaged in a conversation, the dog a small breed with a brown coat stands beside the truck looking up at the man with a curious expression,the sky above is ablaze with hues of orange pink and purple indicating a breathtaking sunset, soft fluffy clouds are scattered across the sky adding to the serene atmosphere, the truck with its vintage design and worn paint blends harmoniously with the natural surroundings, the illustration style is characterized by soft brushstrokes and subtle color gradations giving the scene a warm nostalgic feel, the overall mood is peaceful and contemplative inviting the viewer to pause and appreciate the tranquil moment\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\nthis is a digital illustration in a fantasy art style depicting a serene and mystical forest scene, the central figure is a majestic ethereal deer with large intricately detailed antlers and a slender luminescent coat that glows with a soft blue light, the deer's body appears to be made of a glowing iridescent material giving it an otherworldly appearance, the light emanating from its body illuminates the surrounding environment casting a subtle glow on the dark forest floor,the background is a dense misty forest with tall trees their trunks and branches silhouetted against the dark sky, the foliage is lush and vibrant with various shades of green and purple hues adding to the mystical atmosphere, the forest floor is carpeted with a variety of plants including ferns and wildflowers which add texture and depth to the scene,the overall mood is peaceful and enchanting with the glowing deer serving as the focal point, the color palette is predominantly dark blues and greens with touches of purple and white creating a dreamy magical ambiance\n\n\n<lora:ScenicHorizonsFLUX:1> sc3n1ch0r1s0ns,\n__My wildcards/Lora wildcards/Scenic
